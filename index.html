			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I've always been interested in technology and computers, and I find it fascinating to be able to have absolute control of a machine.
			It's such a rewarding experience when you get something working, it always pays off.
			So this is why I did a superior grade in multi-platform application development, where I used very different technologies.<br>
			<p>And then, another passion I have are video games. For a long time they were just a hobby for me, but as soon as I realized there were careers in game development, 
			I decided that was the right choice. <br>
			And that brings us to the present: I'm currently finishing my career, and I'm looking forward my next projects and challenges.</p>
			
			<h3>Projects<h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Over the clouds</li>
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tvikc6jQz40" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This is the last game I've worked on (2018-19), and it was also made using Unreal Engine.
				<br>We were a small team of 3 people, so we had to carefully manage and plan the time and resources we had.
				<br>The game is still being updated today, but an old beta build can be found <a href="https://wasdproductions.itch.io/over-the-clouds">in here</a>. </p>
				
				<li>Feels like home already</li>
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfqhDDaP3oA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This game was made during 2017-18, and was the first big project I did with Unreal Engine.
				<br>What was cool about this project is that we had 3 artists working for us, so we didn't have to worry too much about the art, and the final result looks so much better.
				<br>It was a cool project that helped me better understand Unreal.</p>
				
				<li>Dash & slice</li> 
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r15SAXl70pE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This project was very fun to make, mostly because of its nature (it's a multiplayer game), so we often had to do the tests ourselves and that meant 
				we got to compete with each other in the process. People who tried the game seemed very happy. It was made with Unity and up to 4 players could play simultaneously.</p>
				<p>You can download this game <a href="https://wasdproductions.itch.io/dashslice">right here</a>.</p>
				
				<li>Ghost and Goblins remake</li>
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5J88B7wAFc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This game was a class project where we focused on using Agile methodology, which I think is incredibly useful in software development.
				<br>This was a remake of an already existing arcade game, popular by its difficulty, and we tried to capture that in our game aswell.
				Of course that meant we didn't have to create art, but we had to edit all the sprite sheets, and all the code was made by us. It was our first time using JavaScript, 
				and we used a game framework called Phaser.</p>
				<p>You can play this game in your browser <a href="https://binrongzheng.github.io/ghost-n-goblins/GAME/">right here</a> (it can't be played on phones because it requires a keyboard).</p>
				
				<li>Mad Lab</li>
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqUCoPHKAaA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This was our very first game we made, so we didn't have much knowledge of either Unity (the game engine used) or game development at all.
				<br>But because of that, it was also a great opportunity to learn a lot, all while also working in a team.</p>
