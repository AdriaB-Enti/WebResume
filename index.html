			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I've been always been interested in technology and computers, and I find it fascinating to be able to control what the computer does. 
			It's such a rewarding expercience when you get something working, it always pays off.
			So this is why I did a -grau superior de desenvolupament d'aplicacions multiplataforma--<br>
			<p>And then, another passion I have are videogames. For a long time they were just a hobby for me, a hobby I enjoyed a lot, but as soon as I realized there were careers for game development, 
			I decided that was the right choice for me.</p>
			
			<h3>Projects<h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Feels like home already</li>
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfqhDDaP3oA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p> This game was made during 2017-18, and was the first big project I did with Unreal Engine.
				<br>What was cool about this project is that we had 3 artist working for us, so we didn't have to worry too much about the art, and of course the final result  ---</p>
				
				<li>Dash & slice</li> 
				<br>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r15SAXl70pE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This project was very fun to make, mostly because of it's nature (it's a multiplayer game), so we often had to do the tests ourselves and that meant 
				we got to compete with eachother in the process.</p>
				<p>You can download this game <a href="https://wasdproductions.itch.io/dashslice">right here</a>.</p>
				
				<li>Ghost and Goblins remake</li>

				<p>This was our very first game we made, so we didn't have much knowlege of either Unity (the game engine used) or game development.</p>
